qjobs
=====

qjobs is an attempt to get a cleaner and more customizable output than the one
provided by qstat (Sun Grid Engine).

Quick installation
------------------

``qjobs`` is available on PyPI. It is compatible with Python3.4 and higher.

Installation of ``qjobs`` can be done with ``pip``::

    python3 -m pip install -U --user qjobs

That's it! If the directory where pip installs packages (usually
``~/.local/bin``) is in your ``PATH`` environment variable, you only have to
run ``qjobs`` from the command line to launch the wrapper. Enjoy!
